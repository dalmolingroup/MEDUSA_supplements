# MEDUSA supplements

This repository serves as a hub for general and supplementary information related to the manuscript
"MEDUSA: A Pipeline for Sensitive Taxonomic Classification and Flexible Functional Annotation of Metagenomic Shotgun Sequences".

## Project repositories

- [**MEDUSA**](https://github.com/dalmolingroup/MEDUSA):
  The main repository for the research project,
  it contains the pipeline's Snakemake rules (The Snakefile),
  as well as instructions on how to execute the workflow.

- [**annotate**](https://github.com/dalmolingroup/annotate):
  A repository containing the Annotate script implemented by the pipeline,
  which is responsible for annotating each query in the alignment output.

- [**ComparisonMEGANxMEDUSA**](https://github.com/dalmolingroup/ComparisonMEGANxMEDUSA):
  Contains the scripts used to compare the taxonomic and functional results produced by both MEDUSA and MEGAN as well as the data that supports the article.

## Supplementary information

- Supplementary tables, notes, as well as details for installing and running the pipeline
  can be found in the 'SupplementaryMaterialFrontiers' PDF available as an adjacent file in this repository.
